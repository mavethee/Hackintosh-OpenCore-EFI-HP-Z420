https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases/tag/0.7.7

### Please note:
Since OC 0.6.5, I decided to switch to RELEASE version, if you expierience any issues, switch to debug using Dortania's Guide:

https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/troubleshooting/debug.html

I've used natively supported GPU, you should too ;)

Internal USBs doesnt work so USBInjectAll was skipped!

For working USBs I used this PCIe expansion card (native support, no kexts needed):

### SMBIOS:
Present in repo SMBIOS is not purchased Apple's device but for own sake, I don't advice you to use it.
...for own sake ;)

To generate SMBIOS you can use:
* GenSMBIOS:
https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS
* OpenCore Auxiliary Tools:
https://github.com/ic005k/QtOpenCoreConfig

Tool doesn't matter really, you just need not valid or unused SMBIOS to copy-paste needed info.
...if you wish to use iServices of course :)
